# disease-prediction

This project aims to provide a simple, accessible tool for disease prediction by leveraging machine learning. The system allows users to select their symptoms, which are then analyzed by a trained model to predict the most probable disease.

The primary goal is to create a reliable and user-friendly application that can aid in early disease awareness and provide a quick reference for health-related queries. This system is not a substitute for professional medical advice but can serve as an educational and preliminary diagnostic tool.

âœ¨ Features
Symptom-Based Prediction: Predicts a disease based on a list of selected symptoms.

Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a Random Forest Classifier trained on a comprehensive dataset.

User-Friendly Interface: A simple web application built with Flask or Streamlit for easy interaction.

Model Accuracy: The model is trained to achieve a high level of accuracy on unseen data.
